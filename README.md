# Machine-Learning-based-method-to-label-signals-from-people-with-neurological-injuries

This is an open-source project to identify events in sEMG signals from people with neurological diseases.

Interfaces that use sEMG signals face the challenge of correctly identifying the signal while distinguishing it from noise or interference. Although classical techniques like visual inspection and machine learning methods exist, most studies focus on signals from healthy individuals. There is a lack of data and methods suitable for signals from individuals with neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsy and post-stroke. This study analyzes sEMG data from individuals with neurological injuries, using machine learning methods to identify muscle contractions and rest without pre-processing. The data were acquired from people with neurological diseases, such as cerebral palsy and post-stroke and were extracted using sEMG from triceps brachii and extensor carpi radialis muscles. The signals were not preprocessed and were input as segmented time windows to three proposed classifiers: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and an Ensemble Voting classifier. All three classifiers reached around 99% accuracy and F1-Score on typical sEMG data, but the results on abnormal data were inconclusive.
